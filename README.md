1. **Briefly state how much of the project you completed, e.g. which of the sub tasks work.**

    
I completed all the required parts; they should be working.

2. **Briefly discuss one thing you learned by completing this assignment that you believe will be valuable to you in your future courses / programming experiences.**

Getting more familiar with python and setting up that testing infrastructure was really cool.
3. **Briefly discuss either one aspect of this assignment you did not enjoy or one particular difficult bug you encountered.**

It wasn't so much that I encountered difficult bugs but more that I was learning as I went, so I got stuck a lot. For example, at first I made a lot of mistakes just setting up the tests and I wasn't sure how to do the script to run through the testbench directory for a while.
